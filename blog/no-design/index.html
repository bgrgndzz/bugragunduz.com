# No Design is the Best Design

I'm not going to lie and say that I don't fall in love with the Stripe landing page every time I see it, and I'm not going to refuse that I spend an uncomfortably long time scrolling through dribbble, mesmerized by literal works of art in product form. However, we need to have a fundamental shift in how we think about design.

Design is one of the hardest things to define in the world. For me, it has always been about interaction. Even if you don't click anything on an app, you are interacting with it, because you are sensing it actively with your eyes. Deciding about the nature of any active interaction, is design. 

Here's the thing: when I enter a website and I interact with it, I do it for the sole purpose of reaching a certain goal. Anything that distracts me from that goal is bad design. When I add a to do to my to do list, I don't want to go through 8 different input fields and create an entire document. I just wanted to buy milk, but you made me fill out an entire job application at a grocery chain. 

Shifting from the product design mindset of "design for the sake of beauty and organization" to "design for the sake of the customer's use case" makes it pretty easy to spot and fix these design errors. Anytime you are designing an interaction, ask yourself, "who will use this?" and "what do they want to do?" More often than not, they will want to get to that goal as fast as possible. If I want to remember that I want to buy milk, I want to be able to add that to my to do list with as high bandwidth as possible. The interaction's speed should be limited only by my fingers' ability to type fast. Everything else is a distraction, and is bad design.

No design is the best design.

Think about it, If I want to save a to do, I want to type in a to do and nothing else. The best possible interaction in this case is telepathy. The second best possible interaction is a simple command prompt. Makers of to do list apps, take notes (no pun intended). Users should be able to press cmd+E and just type in "buy milk today #personal, high priority." And the app should handle the rest. There is only so many combinations of these words, so I shouldn't need to learn some special syntax. I should be able to type in "buy milk date:today priority:high tags:personal" and the app should understand. This is not high technology, this is baseline nlp. Designers might have to give up their pretty color palettes in favor of backend engineers, but efficient and designless interactions are what design intended to be. 

It is incredibly well thought-out design, wrapped up in a façade of no design.

And it is, in fact, the best design.

Take a look at all the tools you use in a day. When you enter Google Analytics, subconsciously, you think about what the buttons on the sidebar mean, and what you need to click on to get to the report you want to look at. If you want to see what your best converting segments are, where do you need to click? If you can not visualize a clear pathway to that report in your mind, and that is the case for the vast majority of its advanced users as well as all of their beginning users, drop that tool now. It does not enable you; it makes you depend on it and it cripples you. To analyze best segments in Google Analytics, you need to create a report for each dimension of your analysis, go through each and combine the list into one manually, calculate conversion increases, and then decide on which segment you need to focus your marketing efforts on. When in fact, with simple statistics and no design, you can reach [all of that without a single click](https://www.hockeystack.com/features#insights):

So next time you design something, design an invisible interaction. I promise your customers will thank you.
