# Crypto actually seems like a good use of carbon-based electricity

I first heard about NFTs when Beeple put his “Everydays: The First 5000 Days” on auction. NFT isn’t exactly a new concept - it is based on existing Ethereum technology - so I was shocked to see so many articles pop up about their environmental impact. The same environmental concerns exist in other blockchain technologies too, but these aren’t raised this often.

It is true that Ethereum, and most other blockchains, have a negative impact on the environment. To validate transactions, blockchain “miners” expend computational resources and get rewarded with money. The mining operation already uses a lot of electricity, and the electricity used per block mined is constantly increasing. Storing digital art as an NFT works much the same way. It is said that some NFTs’ [“carbon footprint is equivalent to an EU resident’s electricity usage for two months.”](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change) I think part of the reason the environmental issues got so much attention is that spending 2 months of electricity for a GIF of a [“cat in a rocket heading to the moon”](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change) is absolutely ridiculous at first sight. However, these examples are just **lazy strawmen**.

It is time to accept that our society is run on technology. **Most of our lives are digital**, now including our workplaces and friendships thanks to the pandemic. In the near future, the human body will be partly digital. I view NFTs as an integral part of the transition to a fully digital life. They encode property and ownership in bits and store it in decentralized networks where no one can interfere with your rights. Taking another step back, cryptocurrencies do the same thing for our money. Before, institutions and governments could easily access the fruits of our labor, altering their value through central policies, taking them from you whenever they saw fit. Cryptocurrencies prevent this, finally decentralizing finance and taking power away from the pervasive bully that is the hands-on government. **These technologies bring true democracy and freedom to the human experience.** In 2021, they are crucial.

Why, then, can we tolerate the emissions associated with other activities? Why is production cheered on while a system dedicated to storing the fruits of production in a decentralized way is demonized? Surely the former uses more energy than the latter, but I don’t see daily headlines portraying producers as dumb nerds playing around while destroying the world. Beeple committed to spending the appropriate amount of his $69M on making his artwork carbon-negative. Ethereum is switching to a proof-of-stake model where mining becomes obsolete and so does electricity use. **The problem is real, and these people are clearly working to find a solution.** However, even if there wasn’t a solution, I would say the emissions associated with constructing a completely new way of exchanging goods and services and storing the value of our labor is absolutely worth it.

If you haven’t realized by now, I am heavily pro-tech. I think the issue here is that the overwhelming majority of media outlets are anti-tech. I have never understood this. If we could only see the longer-term implications of blockchain, we wouldn’t be talking only about the anti-tech arguments. We would find a way to make it work, because we would want to push humanity forward. Unfortunately, the public is swayed by media’s attempts to discredit technology. What is media’s interest in protecting the status quo? I don’t know, [please email me if you know the answer.](mailto:bgrgndzz@gmail.com) For now, we have to rely on individual activists to increase our awareness and hopefully build a sizable cheering section for a future enhanced with the possibilities that technology offers. This is already starting with blockchains and NTFs.
